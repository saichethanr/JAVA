inversion of control : we are ok with the flow of the application but now with the object creation
we are  responsible for the  creation of object and the maintainence of the object and destroying of the object
by doing so we loose the concentration on buisness logic and not on the object creation. so someone else has to control the creatin of object
To manage this in spring we have Ioc container. Spring will create objects for us and keep in this container

How exactly we will make the above work?


Design Pattern : dependency injection
all classes are created inside the Ioc container how do we inject in each other we we have to use them
